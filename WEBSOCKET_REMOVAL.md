# WebSocket Removal Summary

All WebSocket functionality has been removed from the frontend as requested.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/front-end/server.js`
**Before:** 109 lines with WebSocket server setup
**After:** 32 lines - clean Next.js server only

**Removed:**
- WebSocket server on port 3001
- Client connection management
- `sendToWebSocketClient` global function
- WebSocket event handlers

**Result:** Simple Next.js HTTP server

### 2. `/front-end/src/app/signup/basic/page.tsx`
**Removed:**
- `wsRef` reference
- WebSocket connection logic in `useEffect`
- WebSocket reconnection logic
- WebSocket event handlers (onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose)
- `paymentHash` state (no longer needed without WS)

**Result:** Clean page with just invoice creation and QR code display

### 3. `/front-end/src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`
**Before:** Webhook that sent messages to WebSocket clients
**After:** Simple webhook receiver (TODO for future implementation)

**Removed:**
- Client ID extraction
- `sendToWebSocketClient` calls
- WebSocket client lookup logic

**Result:** Placeholder webhook endpoint

### 4. `/front-end/package.json`
**Removed dependencies:**
- `ws` (^8.18.3) - WebSocket server library
- `@types/ws` (^8.18.1) - TypeScript types for ws

**Result:** Cleaner dependency list

## Files Deleted

### `/front-end/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
Complete custom WebSocket hook deleted (136 lines)

**Features that were removed:**
- Auto-connect/disconnect
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Message queue
- Connection state management
- Client ID tracking

## What Was Removed

### Server-side (server.js)
```javascript
// ❌ Removed
- WebSocket server on port 3001
- Client connection tracking (Set)
- Client ID assignment
- Global sendToWebSocketClient function
```

### Client-side (page.tsx)
```javascript
// ❌ Removed
- WebSocket connection setup
- Payment notification listening
- Auto-reconnection logic
- Connection error handling
```

### Hook (useWebSocket.ts)
```javascript
// ❌ Completely deleted
- Full custom WebSocket hook
```

## Current State

### What Still Works
✅ Invoice creation via backend API
✅ QR code generation
✅ UI/UX for payment page
✅ Success state handling (manual trigger only)

### What Doesn't Work Anymore
❌ Real-time payment notifications
❌ Auto-redirect after payment
❌ WebSocket connection status
❌ Payment status updates

### Manual Payment Testing
To test payment flow now, you'll need to:
1. Display the QR code
2. Make the payment externally
3. Manually trigger success (for testing)

## To Re-implement WebSockets Later

When you're ready to add WebSockets back:

1. **Server Setup:**
   - Add WebSocket server to backend (port 4000 or separate port)
   - Implement phoenixd webhook listener
   - Forward payment notifications to WebSocket clients

2. **Client Setup:**
   - Re-create useWebSocket hook or use library
   - Connect to backend WebSocket
   - Listen for payment events

3. **Integration:**
   - phoenixd → webhook → backend → WebSocket → frontend
   - Payment detected → send notification → update UI

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Polling (Simple)
```typescript
// Poll backend for payment status every 5 seconds
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    const status = await checkPaymentStatus(paymentHash);
    if (status === 'paid') {
      handlePaymentSuccess();
    }
  }, 5000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [paymentHash]);
```

### Option 2: Server-Sent Events (Simpler than WS)
```typescript
// Backend sends events when payment is detected
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/payment-events');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.type === 'payment') {
    handlePaymentSuccess();
  }
};
```

### Option 3: WebSocket (Full-featured)
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Best for complex real-time features
- More setup required

## Clean Slate

The frontend is now clean and ready for you to implement the payment notification system in the way you prefer. All WebSocket code has been removed as requested.
